/**
*                              -- OPERATORS --
*                  ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=, ===, !==, ||, &&
*
*  These are the conditional statements that are used pretty often :
*
*  == : Structural Equality :-
*       Please donâ€™t misunderstand this equality operator with the Java == operator as both are different.
*       == operator in Kotlin only compares the data or variables, whereas in Java or other
*       languages == is generally used to compare the references.
* != : Negated part of ==
*
* ===  Referential equality :-
*       This operator is used to compare the reference of two variable or object.
*       It will only be true if both the objects or variables pointing to the same object.
* !== : Negated part of ===
*
*  <= : less than equal to
*  >= : greater than equals to
*  < : less than
*  > : greater than
*
*  || : OR operator
*  && : AND operator
*
